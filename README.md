# Vikode's Saga for Knowledge

### [**Enter Saga**](https://github.com/JLatham85/vikodes-saga-for-knowledge)

<!--Write a paragraph ot 2 About the website, it's function and goals-->

Vikode’s Saga for Knowledge is a dynamic, quiz-based web application forged in the fires of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed as a battle between mind and myth, this site transforms traditional learning into an interactive duel—where each question is a strike, and each answer shapes the outcome of a fight scene above.

The goal of this project is to gamify knowledge acquisition through responsive feedback, immersive visuals, and progressive challenge. Users engage in quiz battles, earning damage for correct answers and taking hits for mistakes. Future expansions may include flashcard rituals for missed questions, difficulty glyphs, unlockable warriors, and gear upgrades—making this not just a quiz, but a journey through the realms of learning.

## Design Choices

<details open> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

#### **Typography**

To reflect the mythic tone and interactive nature of Vikode’s Saga for Knowledge, the following typefaces were chosen (review table below). These fonts were selected to balance narrative immersion with functional clarity, ensuring users can engage with the content while feeling part of a mythic journey. I will also have sans-serif font to back in case original choices fail.

| Font             |      Utilisation         |
| ---------------- | :----------------------: |
| Cinzel           | Main titles & Headings   |
| Open Sans        | Main body of text        |
| Accent Font      | Sparingly for UI elements|

#### **Color Scheme** <!--Use a contrast site as well and mention this-->

<!--CSS Name - Color in css thats pre-determined-->

The color scheme for Vikode’s Saga for Knowledge was chosen to evoke the intensity of battle, the elegance of myth, and the clarity of learning. [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Color Palette](docs/design/color-palette.png)

<!--Comment - Where is this predetermined color for-->

The below will display that I have used a contrast grid to make sure website is visually appearing but also accessible to all who will view, also I have noted the root CSS Variables I will be utilising. [Eight Shapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Contrast Grid](docs/design/contrast-grid.png)

- CSS Variables

All the below where contrasted then selected for the different categories and will be used as the CSS Variables thoughtout my code. Assisted by [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to get a visual prior to selection.

#### **Images** <!--Insert any tools used to generate images and add which programme we used to render-->

A lot of the images were taken new by myself. However wikipedia was used for the image under the section title. Co-pilot was used for the Icons on the cards.

#### **Responsiveness**

The completed website will be responsive to the Bootstrap breakpoints, which will for all screen sizes. This is to assist all viewers to have a seemless experience within the website.

</details>

#### **Responsivness Tests**

<details> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

To ensure a seamless experience across all devices, I followed a mobile-first approach during development. Starting with the smallest viewport, I designed and tested the layout on an iPhone to prioritize clarity and usability for adventurers on the go. I then progressively scaled the interface, checking responsiveness on an iPad, laptop, and full desktop display. This iterative testing helped refine layout behavior, image scaling, and content flow—ensuring the Vikodes Saga for Knowledge site remains immersive and accessible across screen sizes.

| Device  | Screen Size Range | Testing Focus                      | Result |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| iPhone  | 375px             | Mobile-first layout, image scaling | Passed |
| iPad    | 768px             | Grid wrapping, card alignment      | Passed |
| Laptop  | 1200px            | Content spacing, header behavior   | Passed |
| Desktop | 1400px            | Full-width layout, visual balance  | Passed |
