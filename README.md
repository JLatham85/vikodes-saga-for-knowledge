# Vikode's Saga for Knowledge

### [**Enter Saga**](https://github.com/JLatham85/vikodes-saga-for-knowledge)

<!--Write a paragraph ot 2 About the website, it's function and goals-->

Vikode’s Saga for Knowledge is a dynamic, quiz-based web application forged in the fires of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed as a battle between mind and myth, this site transforms traditional learning into an interactive duel—where each question is a strike, and each answer shapes the outcome of a fight scene above.

The goal of this project is to gamify knowledge acquisition through responsive feedback, immersive visuals, and progressive challenge. Users engage in quiz battles, earning damage for correct answers and taking hits for mistakes. Future expansions may include flashcard rituals for missed questions, difficulty glyphs, unlockable warriors, and gear upgrades—making this not just a quiz, but a journey through the realms of learning.

## User Goals<!--Add what I believe the user goals are-->

The primary goal of Vikode’s Saga for Knowledge is to transform learning into an engaging, interactive experience. Users aren’t just answering questions—they’re stepping into a battle arena where knowledge becomes power and every answer shapes the outcome of a fight.

This project aims to:

- Make learning fun and immersive through gamified quiz mechanics
- Provide immediate feedback with visual cues and health-based consequences
- Encourage replayability and mastery by tracking performance and offering future   flashcard reviews
- Support different learning styles with visual storytelling, interactive elements, and progressive challenge

By blending education with narrative and interactivity, this saga invites users to learn not just with their minds—but with their mythic spirit.

## Design Choices

<details open> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

#### **Typography**

I have decided to go with 3 different fonts to keep inline with boargaming theme, please see below table for fonts and uses. I have chose these fonts to keep it clean and easy readable but to also have differentials and make the website pop a little. I will also have sans-serif font to back in case original choices fail.

| Font             |      Utilisation      |
| ---------------- | :-------------------: |
| Anton            | Main titles for pages |
| Permanent Marker |  Subtitles for pages  |
| Oswald           |   Main body of text   |

#### **Color Scheme** <!--Use a contrast site as well and mention this-->

<!--CSS Name - Color in css thats pre-determined-->

The color scheme is based of the original Gloomhaven box to keep on theme with project. [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Color Palette](docs/design/color-palette.png)

<!--Comment - Where is this predetermined color for-->

The below will display that I have used a contrast grid to make sure website is visually appearing but also accessible to all who will view, also I have noted the root CSS Variables I will be utilising. [Eight Shapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) was the website used for color pallette.

- [Contrast Grid](docs/design/contrast-grid.png)

- CSS Variables

All the below where contrasted then selected for the different categories and will be used as the CSS Variables thoughtout my code. Assisted by [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to get a visual prior to selection.

| CSS Name      |   HEX   |       RGB        | Comment                                    |
| ------------- | :-----: | :--------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
| Cafe Noir     | #513B22 |  rgb(81 59 31)   | Background for forms and unhovered buttons |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for forms and unhovered buttons |
| Captum motuum | #513125 |  rgb(81 49 37)   | Background for hovered buttons             |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for hovered buttons             |
| Bistre        | #28160A |  rgb(40 22 10)   | Background for Header and Footer           |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Foreground for Header and Footer           |
| Raw umber     | #966F51 | rgb(150 111 81)  | Highlight color in Header footer for links |
| Dutch White   | #DBD3AD | rgb(219 211 173) | Main page Background                       |
| Bistre        | #28160A |  rgb(40 22 10)   | Main font color for main pages             |

#### **Images** <!--Insert any tools used to generate images and add which programme we used to render-->

A lot of the images were taken new by myself. However wikipedia was used for the image under the section title. Co-pilot was used for the Icons on the cards.

#### **Responsiveness**

The completed website will be responsive to the Bootstrap breakpoints, which will for all screen sizes. This is to assist all viewers to have a seemless experience within the website.

| Break Point       | Class infix | Dimensions |
| ----------------- | :---------: | ---------- |
| X-Small           |    None     | <576px     |
| Small             |     sm      | >=576px    |
| Medium            |     md      | >=768px    |
| Large             |     lg      | >=992px    |

</details>

#### **Responsivness Tests**

<details> 
<summary><i>Expand Me/ Collapse Me - I'll let you decide</i></summary>

To ensure a seamless experience across all devices, I followed a mobile-first approach during development. Starting with the smallest viewport, I designed and tested the layout on an iPhone to prioritize clarity and usability for adventurers on the go. I then progressively scaled the interface, checking responsiveness on an iPad, laptop, and full desktop display. This iterative testing helped refine layout behavior, image scaling, and content flow—ensuring the Gloomhaven Universe site remains immersive and accessible across screen sizes.

| Device  | Screen Size Range | Testing Focus                      | Result |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| iPhone  | 375px             | Mobile-first layout, image scaling | Passed |
| iPad    | 768px             | Grid wrapping, card alignment      | Passed |
| Laptop  | 1200px            | Content spacing, header behavior   | Passed |
| Desktop | 1400px            | Full-width layout, visual balance  | Passed |

Gloomhaven Universe was officially deployed early on in the project, as I found inconsistencies between the local and Github.

- Access my repository on GitHub and navigate to settings.

- Click on PAGES on the left pane.

- Then SAVE 

- Website live address [GitHub live address](https://jlatham85.github.io/gloomhaven-universe)

- Any future changes either by my peers suggestion or my own perfectionism can be changed and pushed to GitHub.
